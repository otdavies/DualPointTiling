# Diamond Pattern Texture Tiling: Technical Analysis

## Introduction

Traditional texture tiling methods produce visible artifacts at texture boundaries. The diamond pattern texture tiling algorithm presents a solution through overlapping rotated texture samples arranged in a diamond pattern, effectively minimizing these artifacts through strategic sampling and blending.

## Core Algorithm Components

### 1. Grid System

The algorithm operates on two overlapping grids:

**Primary Grid (Corner-Centered)**
$G_1 = \{(i, j) \mid i,j \in \mathbb{Z}\}$

**Secondary Grid (Center-Centered)**
$G_2 = \{(i + 0.5, j + 0.5) \mid i,j \in \mathbb{Z}\}$

### 2. Coordinate Transformation

For any point $P(x, y)$, we compute:

**Nearest Corner Position:**
$C(x,y) = \lfloor(x,y) + 0.5\rfloor$

**Nearest Center Position:**
$M(x,y) = \lfloor(x,y) - (0.5,0.5) + 0.5\rfloor + (0.5,0.5)$

### 3. Rotation System

The rotation transformation matrix $R(\theta)$ for angle $\theta$:

$
R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
$

Applied to point $P$ around center $C$:
$P_{rot} = R(\theta)(P - C) + C$

### 4. Random Rotation Generation

The deterministic random function for position $P(x,y)$:

$random(P) = fract(P_x \cdot 443.897 + P_y \cdot 441.423 + dot(P,P + 19.19))$

Final rotation angle:
$\theta = 2\pi \cdot r \cdot random(P)$
where $r$ is the rotation scale factor.

### 5. Blending Mechanism

Distance calculations:
- $d_C = \|P - C\|^2$ (squared distance to nearest corner)
- $d_M = \|P - M\|^2$ (squared distance to nearest center)

Blend factor computation:
$\beta = clamp((d_M \cdot offset - d_C) \cdot falloff, 0, 1)$

where:
- $offset$ controls the relative influence of center points
- $falloff$ controls the transition sharpness

## Implementation Details

### Coordinate Processing

- Input UV coordinates are normalized to the texture space
- Grid positions are computed using floor and fractional operations
- Distances are calculated using dot products for efficiency

### Sampling Process

- Calculate rotated coordinates for both grid positions
- Sample texture at both rotated positions
- Blend samples using computed blend factor:
   $color_{final} = lerp(color_1, color_2, \beta)$

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Efficiency

The algorithm primarily uses:
- Basic vector operations
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos)
- Two texture samples per fragment
- Simple distance calculations via dot products

## Limitations

- **Corner Artifacts**
   - Four-way intersections of diamond patterns can show subtle discontinuities
   - Severity depends on texture content and parameter selection

- **Computational Cost**
   - Two texture samples per fragment versus one in simple tiling
   - Additional trigonometric operations for rotation

## Practical Applications

The algorithm is particularly effective for:
- Large-scale terrain texturing
- Procedural texture generation
- Architectural visualization
- Dynamic texture mapping
